# Checkout Selector Initialization Fix

## Problem
The country and phone selectors on checkout.php were appearing empty in production, despite having complete implementation with:
- 192 countries with flags and dial codes
- intl-tel-input for international phone numbers
- Select2 for searchable dropdowns
- Country â†” phone synchronization
- Currency switching (RWF/EUR/USD)

## Root Cause
The JavaScript initialization code was running immediately in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) without waiting for:
1. **DOM to be fully loaded** - Elements might not exist yet when code tries to access them
2. **External libraries to be ready** - jQuery, Select2, and intl-tel-input loaded from CDNs might not be available yet

This created race conditions where the code would try to initialize selectors before the DOM elements existed or before the required libraries were loaded, resulting in empty/non-functional selectors.

## Solution
Wrapped the entire initialization code in two defensive layers:

### 1. DOMContentLoaded Event Listener
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // All initialization code here
});
```
Ensures the DOM is fully parsed and all elements are available before trying to access them.

### 2. Library Availability Check
```javascript
function waitForLibraries(callback) {
    const checkInterval = setInterval(function() {
        if (typeof Stripe !== 'undefined' && 
            typeof jQuery !== 'undefined' && 
            typeof jQuery.fn.select2 !== 'undefined' && 
            typeof window.intlTelInput !== 'undefined') {
            clearInterval(checkInterval);
            callback(); // Initialize everything
        }
    }, 50); // Check every 50ms
    
    // Timeout after 10 seconds with error handling
    setTimeout(function() {
        clearInterval(checkInterval);
        // Show error if libraries still not loaded
    }, 10000);
}
```
Polls for library availability and only initializes once all required libraries are loaded.

## Changes Made
**File**: `checkout.php`

1. Added `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper around all initialization code
2. Added `waitForLibraries()` function with:
   - 50ms polling interval
   - 10-second timeout with error handling
   - Checks for: Stripe, jQuery, Select2, intlTelInput
3. Added console.log statements for debugging
4. Maintained all existing functionality - **zero functional changes**, only timing improvements

## Impact
- **No breaking changes** - All existing features work exactly the same
- **No visual changes** - UI/UX remains identical
- **Better reliability** - Selectors initialize correctly even with slow network or CDN delays
- **Better debugging** - Console logs show library loading progress

## Testing
A test file `test_checkout_initialization.html` has been created to verify:
1. DOM ready event fires correctly
2. Libraries load in proper order
3. Selectors populate with data
4. Select2 and intl-tel-input initialize successfully
5. Timing logs show the initialization flow

To test locally:
1. Open `test_checkout_initialization.html` in a browser
2. Check browser console for detailed logs
3. Verify both selectors are populated and functional
4. Test search functionality in both selectors

## Production Verification
After deployment, verify:
1. Country dropdown is populated and searchable
2. Phone input shows country flags and dial codes
3. Changing country updates phone's country code
4. Changing phone's country updates country selector
5. Currency note updates based on selected country
6. Form submission includes properly formatted data

## Files Modified
- `checkout.php` - Added initialization timing wrapper (547 additions, 511 deletions - mostly indentation)

## Files Created
- `test_checkout_initialization.html` - Standalone test to verify the fix

## No New Dependencies
- No new libraries added
- No new CDN dependencies
- Uses existing libraries (jQuery, Select2, intl-tel-input)

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the change can be easily reverted by:
1. Removing the `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper
2. Removing the `waitForLibraries` function
3. Restoring the direct IIFE execution

However, this is highly unlikely as the change is purely defensive and additive.
